# Introduction

In this thesis,We will present a new technology for data management called Graph Database. It is a powerful technology that will revolutionize diﬀerent ﬁelds. The problem with Graph database is the same as every data management program, which is that handling big data in a way where the user can easily analyze, understand and retrieve data in a relatively acceptable duration. Visualizing graphs make us see the full image and discover new patterns. However, limitations of humans perception make human unable to understand or analyze bigger graph. We will talk about two diﬀerent ways for solving this problem. First is representing data on simple charts so that the user can analyze it easily. Second is adding extra features to the graph in order to make it easier to understand.
